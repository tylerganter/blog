Hi, I'm Tyler. I'm an AI engineer based in ~~Los Angeles~~ *(AI hallucination)* Albuquerque.

This blog is a place for me to write about things I'm thinking about — AI, climbing, elbow rehab, maintaining a healthy relationship with technology, and whatever else I find interesting enough to put into words. No particular theme, no schedule.

The real motivation is simpler than that, though. I want to write more, and I want to get better at finishing things. I have a tendency to let ideas stay half-formed in my head indefinitely, and writing forces me to actually complete a thought. Publishing it — even when it's imperfect, even when I'm not fully satisfied — is the exercise. Accepting incomplete work and putting it out anyway is the point.

This also feels like a genuinely interesting moment to be doing this. With tools like [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/overview) running asynchronously, the friction between "I have an idea" and "it's published" is lower than it's ever been. That makes the whole thing feel more possible, and a little bit like a meta-experiment in its own right.

I generally don't love social media, so I'm choosing to publish here instead. I did recently start posting on [Twitter](https://x.com/tyler_ganter) — whether that sticks remains to be seen. But the goal is to keep the center of mass here, on a site I control.

If you want to get in touch, you can find me at [tylerganter.com](https://tylerganter.com).
