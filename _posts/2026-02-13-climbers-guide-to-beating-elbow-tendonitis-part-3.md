## Supplemental Exercise

As I mentioned before, I break supplemental exercises into two categories: injury prevention and base fitness. Assuming pull exercises are paired with push exercises, as climbers there are specific risk areas — predominantly the pulling muscles of the upper body, from the back through the shoulder complex to the elbows, forearms, and fingers.

### Injury Prevention

<div style="color: #b8d4b2;" markdown="1">

These exercises target the specific weak links in the kinetic chain that make climbers prone to elbow issues. The key areas:

- **I's, Y's, and T's** — Target the lower traps and scapular stabilizers. Weak lower traps let the shoulders drift into compromised positions, which cascades down to the elbows.
- **Rotator cuff work** — Internal and external rotation with bands. The shoulder complex is the foundation of the entire pulling chain.
- **FlexBar (Tyler Twist)** — The go-to for lateral epicondylitis rehab. The eccentric load on the wrist extensors has good evidence behind it.
- **Pronator exercises** — Often overlooked, but the pronators share real estate with the flexor group near the medial epicondyle. Strengthening them can reduce strain at the attachment point.
- **Collagen-stimulating exercises** — Eric Horst recommends light, high-rep finger and wrist exercises done 15--30 minutes after taking collagen peptides, timed to coincide with peak collagen availability. The idea is that tendons have limited blood supply (relying on synovial fluid), so you need to specifically stimulate collagen synthesis at the site. I've been experimenting with a modified version using a GripSaver Plus — the verdict is still out, but the logic is sound.
- **Isometric pinches and bicep curls** — Isometric contractions (holding a static position without joint movement) are a well-established rehab tool for tendons. They can help manage pain and begin loading the tendon without the eccentric/concentric stress. Pinch blocks for the fingers, and static holds at 90 degrees for the biceps.
- **[Grassroots Self Treatment](https://www.grassrootsselftreatment.com/products/climbing-cross-training-exercises) Climber's Kit — Strength section** — Esther Smith's program is excellent and purpose-built for climbers. The strength exercises specifically target the upstream mobility and stability issues that lead to overuse injuries downstream.
- **The 3 sidelying exercises** — Sidelying external rotation, sidelying horizontal abduction, and sidelying forward flexion. These hit the rotator cuff and scapular stabilizers in positions that are hard to replicate standing.

### Base Fitness

<div style="color: #b8d4b2;" markdown="1">

If you're only climbing and doing injury prevention work, you're missing a big piece of the puzzle. General strength conditioning reduces injury risk by building a more resilient body overall.

- **Push strength** — Push-ups, dips, overhead press. Climbing is almost entirely pulling, and the resulting imbalance is a recipe for shoulder and elbow problems.
- **Core** — Hollow body holds, hanging leg raises, planks. Good core tension on the wall reduces compensation patterns that strain the elbows.
- **General strength** — Squats, deadlifts, carries. A strong base supports everything above it. Don't neglect the lower body just because you climb.
- **Shoulder stability** — Handstands, ring work, or even just wall slides. The shoulder is the most mobile (and therefore most vulnerable) joint in the pulling chain.

A couple of notes on supplemental exercise in general: be careful of elbow hyperextension, especially if you're hypermobile. Even exercises with "proper form" calling for locked elbows (like planche progressions) may need to be modified with a slight bend. And vary your tools — alternate between dumbbells, exercise bands, and bodyweight. Each loads the tissues slightly differently, which is exactly the kind of varied stimulus that promotes resilient tendons.

## Other Practices

### Massaging

If for nothing else, massaging the body is a crucial means of monitoring it. Take your thumb and poke around in your forearms and around your elbows. Get a foam roller and roll out the underarm and [latissimus dorsi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latissimus_dorsi_muscle). How does this change day to day? From morning to evening?

One word of caution: make sure you know the difference between a trigger point and a nerve. They can feel similar, but with practice there's definitely a difference. In particular, the radial nerve runs right along the medial epicondyle on the tricep region of the arm, so try not to dig into that.

![Anatomical diagram showing the radial nerve running through the forearm]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/elbow-tendonitis/radial-nerve-diagram.png)
*The radial nerve — know where it is so you don't mistake it for a trigger point.*

The budget tool for massaging the forearm is the thumb. If you want to get fancy, warm up some coconut oil or use massage oil.

That said, if you're at all serious about climbing I would highly recommend just ponying up and buying an [Armaid](https://www.armaid.com/products/armaid-1). It's worth the investment. Even if you're not suffering from elbow issues, the Armaid is a great tool for loosening up the forearm fascia while driving to the crag.

Another option is a massage gun. They're getting affordable nowadays. Personally, I enjoy the gun, and it certainly hits differently than the Armaid, but if I had to choose one, the Armaid wins hands down.

### Stretching

I'm putting this after massaging because, from experience, I haven't actually found elbow-specific stretches to be all that important. That said, there are some mobility practices worth incorporating:

<div style="color: #b8d4b2;" markdown="1">

- **Don't overdo the wrist stretches** — This is a common mistake. Aggressive wrist stretching can actually irritate the tendons further, especially during recovery. Gentle is the keyword.
- **[Grassroots Self Treatment](https://www.grassrootsselftreatment.com/products/climbing-cross-training-exercises) Climber's Kit — Mobility section** — Esther Smith's mobility work is well-balanced and climber-specific.
- **[Tom Merrick's Climber's Mobility Routine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-1OJW3OMb4&t=749s)** — Another great resource, though be cautious with the wrist-cranking portions if your elbows are sensitive.
- **Radial nerve glides** — These can be very helpful if nerve tension is contributing to your symptoms. They're gentle movements that help the nerve slide through its surrounding tissues.
- **Neck stretches (McKenzie method)** — I was skeptical, but there is a nerve connection between the neck and the forearm. Some climbers swear by this. For me, it helped temporarily but wasn't the silver bullet I was hoping for.
- **[Lattice Training's](https://latticetraining.com/) stretching protocols** — A solid general-purpose climbing stretch routine.

### Icing

I've heard mixed things about icing. Some say it stimulates blood flow as the iced area warms back up. Some go so far as to claim it provides no benefit. But in the right circumstances, I have found icing to be very helpful.

There are some evenings where my elbows or hands just feel hot, or swollen. If it's really bad it will keep me up at night. On these evenings I will ice the hands, forearms, and elbows, and I can say for certain it helps with sleeping — and I generally feel better the next day.

Be sure to ice only as the final activity of the day, after any exercise, stretching, or massaging is complete. Bonus: take a hot shower after icing to get a bit of hot-cold therapy.

### NSAIDs

![Climbing on an overhanging wall at Maple Canyon, Utah]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/elbow-tendonitis/overhanging-cliff-maple-canyon.jpg)
*Maple Canyon, Utah — where an unexpected conversation changed my approach.*

Last summer I was in Maple Canyon, Utah, and decided to hike up to the [Pipe Dream Cave](https://www.mountainproject.com/area/105739677/the-pipe-dream) to check out the all-stars. At a lull between attempts on one of the center-cave lines, I asked a man in his 60s or 70s what his experience with elbow tendonitis was, and if he had any advice. He responded with a question: "What's the max amount of ibuprofen you can take in a day?"

I'd like to stress again that I am not a medical professional and none of these personal observations should be taken as formal advice.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are yet another topic where I've heard a whole spectrum of opinions. Some say NSAIDs hamper the natural healing process and should be avoided. Others say that the natural healing process is really bad at healing tendons and *should* be hampered with. But the majority would say NSAIDs are going to be beneficial if used at the right dosage at the right stage.

The way I've experimented with NSAIDs (specifically ibuprofen) breaks down into three categories:

1. **Preventative/anticipatory** — If I know I've been struggling recently, I've sometimes taken 400 mg before climbing.
2. **Post-workout** — End of day, elbows feel "hot," want to get a good night's rest. Sometimes 400 mg in the evening. I think of this almost exactly how I think of icing.
3. **Multi-week stint** — Taking a regular amount daily for a month straight.

Category 3 might sound extreme, but it requires some context. While I wouldn't recommend taking NSAIDs for a prolonged period, someone recommended that I take a regular amount daily for a month. At the time I was roughly 1.5 years into my elbow issues and was teetering on the edge of recovery but just couldn't quite avoid the occasional flare-up. I started taking 400 mg three times a day (1200 mg total — which, by the way, is the maximum recommended daily dosage on the label). I felt good the entire month, but I was anxiously anticipating the day I stopped. Well, that day came and went, and my symptoms never really came back.

This was probably the biggest turning point in my entire epicondylitis journey, and I am yet to have any major flare-ups since. Why then, you may ask, is this tucked away in a subsection that isn't even mentioned in "The Big Four"? Well, I'm reluctant to attribute too much to a drug-based solution — particularly when there were other significant factors at play. The Big Four is a collection of recommendations I'm confident will help, not only with recovery but also with long-term health and prevention. The turning point I'm describing here was, without a doubt, built on months of rehabilitative exercise and all the other aforementioned factors. Was ibuprofen also an important factor in this late stage of recovery? My gut tells me yes, but it's hard to know for certain. What does this mean for you? I'd recommend NSAIDs as a valuable addition to your tool belt, but they are certainly not a panacea.

### Diet and Supplements

It should go without saying that if you're putting all of this time and effort into your climbing, you should be respecting your body with good food as well. I won't elaborate much here — there are plenty of good resources on diet, both general and climbing-specific.

> "Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants." — Michael Pollan

Most workout days I make a post-workout whey protein shake and load it with greens and fruit. Hemp seed powder, pea protein, flax meal, and spirulina are all good high-protein vegan options to mix in.

As I mentioned, I've been experimenting with pre-workout collagen peptides, but it's difficult to say if they make any difference. From what I've read, it seems like it won't hurt — something that can't be said for many supplements.

At the bottom of my list of recommendations: I've also been taking a daily [fish oil supplement](https://www.livestrong.com/article/89893-fish-oil-tendonitis/) accompanied by a daily dose of skepticism.

### Acupuncture and Dry-Needling

I've yet to really experiment with either of these methods. I did have a dry-needling session recently, but since I was essentially asymptomatic at the time it felt like it did more harm than good. Anecdotally I've heard good things about both (more often dry-needling), and I'll consider it again in the future if symptoms return.

### Taping and Braces

I haven't really tried taping, but there are sources that recommend both rigid tape and K-tape. I did use [tennis elbow braces](https://www.amazon.com/Tomight-Elbow-Brace-Tennis-Compression/dp/B01M0F5IA4) during the early acute phase. They were particularly valuable with typing, since that was something I couldn't easily take a break from.

In the acute phase of epicondylitis, these strategies can provide some relief while climbing, but in the category of "relief while climbing" I had better luck with NSAIDs.

### Rest

<div style="color: #b8d4b2;" markdown="1">

Rest is the easiest thing to recommend and the hardest thing to actually do. Two things to keep in mind:

- **Enough rest days in a week.** If you're climbing three days a week, make sure they're not three days in a row. Your tendons need recovery time between sessions, and unlike muscles, tendons are slow to heal and slow to adapt. Two to three climbing days per week with rest days between them is a good starting point during recovery.
- **Take a week or two off a few times a year.** Periodized programs usually build this in, but if you're not following one, schedule it yourself. These rest periods give the tendons a chance to fully catch up on repair. I know it feels like you're losing fitness — and you are, a little — but the long-term payoff of healthy tendons far outweighs a minor detraining blip.

## Conclusion

<div style="color: #b8d4b2;" markdown="1">

If I'm being honest, the root of my tendonitis was indoor over-training during those Michigan winters — high volume, no structure, all enthusiasm and no planning. It took me a long time to admit that.

I owe a lot to the physical therapists I've worked with. PTs have been the most true to this holistic approach, but it's hard to imbue the level of dedication required in a 45-minute appointment. This kind of shift — in how you view your body, your training, your entire relationship to climbing — has to come from within.

A few final thoughts:

- **Everyone is different.** My journey is not going to be your journey. The specifics of what worked for me may not work for you, and vice versa.
- **Listen to your body.** This is the most vacuous advice in all of fitness, and it's also the most important. You'll only learn what it means through practice.
- **Consult a professional.** Or two. Or five, as I did. Different PTs bring different perspectives, and sometimes the fifth one tells you the thing that clicks.

I'm not sponsored by any of the products or resources mentioned here. Maybe I should be? But honestly, I'd rather this remain an unbiased account. Take what's useful, discard what isn't, and remember that the goal isn't to follow some perfect protocol — it's to develop the knowledge and body awareness to take care of yourself for a lifetime of climbing.
