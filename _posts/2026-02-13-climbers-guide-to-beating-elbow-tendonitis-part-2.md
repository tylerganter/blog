## Elbow Fundamentals

Let's have a quick lesson on the basics. As mentioned, the technical term for this injury is epicondylitis. Lateral epicondylitis refers to pain on the outside epicondyle (the bony protrusion), connected to the forearm extensors, which pull the wrist backwards. Medial epicondylitis refers to pain on the inner epicondyle, connected to the forearm flexors, which pull the wrist downwards.

<!-- TODO: Image — forearm extensors and flexors anatomy -->

Overuse and improper recovery can lead to micro-tears in the tendons attaching the extensors and flexors to the epicondyles. In the first 6--8 weeks this is an inflammatory process called **tendonitis**. Beyond 8 weeks we call it **tendonosis**. It would be inaccurate to consider tendonosis as just "stubborn tendonitis" — the condition changes to something chronic. At this point the tendon is failing to properly repair. It's going to require stimulation to trigger the repair process of synthesizing new, healthy tendon collagen.

### Why Lateral?

Okay, medial epicondylitis makes sense. As climbers we're constantly contracting the forearm flexors to grip hard on tiny holds. But why is lateral epicondylitis so prevalent as well?

One factor is that the wrist is a complex joint. Consider the elbow, which can be described as a "dumb joint" — it has only one motion, back and forth. To bend the elbow one simply engages the bicep; during this contraction the tricep remains relaxed. Similarly, to straighten the elbow the tricep engages but the bicep does not. Contrary to the elbow, the wrist has a wide range of complex movements: up, down, side to side. When the wrist is pulled downward, contracting the forearm flexors, the forearm extensors engage as well, in order to stabilize the wrist.

But there's another factor, which I theorize is more important.

Think about the last time you tried opening a really tight jar. Where did you hold it? Did you have your arms straight out? No — you probably bent your elbows and held it close to your waist so you could really "get over it." As it turns out, your grip strength is greatest when your wrist is cranked back. I wrap my head around this by thinking of it as pre-loading the flexor group.

Put your hand out in front of you, palm down. Pull your wrist down as much as you can — what happens to your fingers? Are they straight or bent? Now pull your wrist back as much as possible — what are your fingers doing now? If you have any doubts (thinking maybe this is just gravity at work), turn your wrist palm up and do the same thing.

There is very little muscle in the hands, particularly in the fingers. It's more like a puppet show manipulated by the forearm marionettes. When your wrist is pulled back, thanks to engagement of the forearm extensors, the flexor group is in a maximally pre-loaded state — which is why the fingers want to contract in. There is no extra "string" to allow the fingers to extend. When the flexor muscles now engage, the fingers have already been contracted a significant amount, and thus this extra contraction pulls in that much harder.

<!-- TODO: Image — jar opening and tendon pre-loading concept illustration -->

Yes, you are right. This is exactly what chicken winging is, although with a different order of operations. Imagine you're getting pumped on a crimpy climb and your forearm flexors are already maximally engaged. If your wrist is in line with your forearm, you can still pull those strings of the fingers back a bit harder — not by contracting the forearm flexors harder, but by moving them further away from the ends of the fingers. And thus the elbow works its way up higher as you try desperately to cling onto the hold.

Between wrist stabilization and this pre-loading, chicken-winging effect, I would argue that the latter is the bigger culprit. It just feels more apparent if you play around with these movements. And I've definitely noticed it climbing as well. This is good news because, unlike wrist stabilization, elbow position is something you can modify in your climbing to reduce the load on your forearm extensors. Think of it maybe like full crimping — something that should be minimized during training, despite the fact that we all know we're going to hunker down on that limit project. The difference is that chicken winging is more due to fatigue; if your elbows start to escape your sides while climbing indoors, get down immediately. It's time to rest.

## Acute Phase

If this is your first time with tendonitis (remember, it is correct to call it tendonitis during this acute phase), go see a therapist. You need to make sure you are properly diagnosed and that immediate action is taken to mitigate the issue.

This is also the one time that I would recommend not climbing whatsoever. You've developed an overuse injury, so you need to immediately alleviate the stresses that are causing it. That could be climbing too hard, climbing too much, or likely a combination. Even calisthenics can be problematic for elbows and should be paused.

You need to consider anything and everything that could be causing strain. In this acute phase, it's possible to be very sensitive. How are you sleeping? If you wake up with your wrists bent down like a T-rex, you're spending the entire night in a position that loads the forearm extensors. Ideally, sleep on your back with your arms at your sides, wrists neutral. Stick a pillow under your knees to help discourage you from turning. Do you work on a computer? Typing can be another problematic habit. Get an external keyboard that can be raised on the side closer to you, so your wrists can bend down instead of constantly being pulled back and lightly engaging the extensors. Also try to change things up — having your hands at exactly the same position on a keyboard for 8 hours a day is bad, regardless of what that position is.

### Transitioning Out of the Acute Phase

Once you start to reach that 8-week point (give or take, at the discretion of your physical therapist), you need to start shifting towards long-term practices for maintenance and recovery.

Barring that initial unloading phase, I have some important and exciting advice for you: **DON'T STOP CLIMBING!** You're going to have to take it very light at first, and back off the volume and intensity any time your symptoms get worse, but a little discomfort is okay. It's going to take a long time for you to get attuned to what your body can handle as sufficient stimulus for recovery without regressing with further damage. Recall that this phase is now considered tendonosis — it is not going to go away if you do not properly stimulate the repair process. I have heard too many stories, myself included, of taking swaths of time off from climbing only to have the elbow pain return as soon as you get back on the rock.

So the next sections all relate to good practices during the chronic tendonosis phase and after recovery. You're going to have to start easy and be ready to adapt to your body's response as you experiment with increasing the loads. Get excited — you're about to learn so much about your body, and even better, you're going to get some climbing in along the way.

## Periodized Programs

<!-- TODO: Image — training calendars / periodization schedule -->

I remember being back in Michigan, before my elbow issues, when a friend proposed that we try the Rock Climber's Training Manual Rock Prodigy training program. She described it as this "crazy regiment" where you spend a whole month just hangboarding. Sounded about right at the time. In retrospect, I would call it crazy *not* to follow one of these programs.

Do you periodize your climbing? Or are you asking what that even means? Periodized training is a practice of changing things up, so as to avoid plateaus and mitigate risk of injury. It can be as simple as changing your day-to-day activities — limit bouldering one day and getting lots of volume on easy rope climbs the next. This is called daily undulating periodization (DUP). Or it could be as complex as a months-long program where every day is planned to a T. If you're going for the latter, just keep in mind that if this is your first time you will guaranteed need to adapt something, especially if you're still recovering from an injury.

There is so much to learn here, but as an example, the Rock Climber's Training Manual provides a heuristic to follow a 4:1 climbing-to-campusing ratio during the power phase — for every minute of campus training you spend four minutes bouldering. Sure, it's just a heuristic, but it's an incredibly valuable starting point to reduce your risk of injury while campus training.

Rick Richey with the National Academy of Sports Medicine (NASM) has a great podcast series to get your brain crunching:

- [*Exercise Programming and Periodization*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVMoYfK7mEw&t=663s)
- [*More on Exercise Periodization and Programming*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZWIuoKtPV0)
- [*Even More on Exercise Periodization and Programming*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcCP04M-XWI&t=901s)

Where should you start? There are a lot of resources out there. While I don't want to imply that in the long term it's necessary to follow a strict program, you'd do well to follow one for at least a couple macro-cycles. (A macro-cycle is the months-long program broken into multi-week meso-cycles and day-to-day micro-cycles.)

**[RCTM](https://rockclimberstrainingmanual.com/):** The Anderson brothers' *Rock Climber's Training Manual* (RCTM) is an excellent resource and particularly something I'd recommend for beginners as it is very structured. By this point I've memorized that page 184 has the example training programs mapped out day by day for both beginner and advanced trainees. This book is dense, but each phase-specific chapter starts with a technical background section that can be skipped if you just want the exercises, and you'll have plenty of time to read each chapter before that particular phase begins.

**[NASM OPT Model](https://www.nasm.org/certified-personal-trainer/the-opt-model):** The National Academy of Sports Medicine's Optimal Performance Training (OPT) Model is a framework for periodizing general fitness. It's a bit gimmicky in that a lot of the resources try to sell you on personal trainer certification, but nonetheless it's a good model. If nothing else, refer to the "resistance" column of tables 14.7--14.11 in [this study guide](http://www.thehealthygamer.com/2013/06/12/nasm-study-guide-chapter-14-integrated-program-design-and-the-optimum-performance-training-opt-model/). I like using these guidelines for reps, sets, tempo, and rest interval for supplemental exercises accompanying a climbing phase. For example, pair OPT's stabilization endurance exercises with RCTM's base fitness phase, and OPT's hypertrophy, max strength, and power exercises with RCTM's strength, power, and power-endurance phases, respectively.

**[T4C](https://trainingforclimbing.com/buy-books/training-for-climbing-3rd-edition-2016/):** I haven't yet delved into Eric Horst's *Training for Climbing* (T4C), but I would say it is the leading competitor to RCTM. Not that you should choose one over the other when you can read them both. The programs are generally shorter, spanning only ~6--10 weeks in contrast to RCTM's 17-week program, and Horst talks about his programs as building blocks that can be adjusted and stacked together to fit your schedule. I'd recommend reading this after RCTM because of the higher degree of flexibility — the onus is on you.

Some other resources I've been looking forward to exploring:

- **[Lattice Training](https://latticetraining.com/)** — They offer more than just awesome YouTube videos. They have personalized training programs at affordable prices. I played around with the [Crimpd](https://www.crimpd.com/) app and was a bit disappointed with the lack of customization (e.g., ARC training sessions had to be exactly 20 minutes), but I still look forward to going all in on a Lattice program for a few months.
- **[ClimberFit](https://www.macrofit.co/climberfit/)** — I don't know much about Alex Puccio's 6-week program, but I'm curious to try an app-based program. Frankly, I'll take any advice the Pooch has to offer.
- **[The Climbing Bible](https://www.v-publishing.co.uk/books/climbing/climbing-the-climbing-bible/)** — A relatively new entry in the running for ultimate comprehensive training guide, published in Fall 2020. I look forward to adding this to the library.

Looking for something more intimate? Go to your gym. Here in Albuquerque there are bouldering training programs for adults, as well as personal trainers for those who are interested.

## Climbing

*The Windows Route, Sedona, AZ*

You should get back to climbing sooner rather than later, but there are some additional things to consider before, during, and after.

### Before

Warming up is essential to reducing risk of injury. Personally, I've been preferring to warm up on the ground — on a mat and with exercise bands. But many swear by warming up on easy climbs, and ideally you should probably do both. Particularly in cold weather, it's important to do one or two easy climbs to get blood flowing through the upper extremities. Biking to the gym and hiking to the crag don't count. You have to warm up the upper body.

As far as warming up on the ground, at minimum you should do one exercise for each of the fingers, wrists, shoulders, and back. Open and close the hands rapidly for 30 seconds or so to get some blood flowing in the forearms. Do some wrist circles. Shoulder dislocates with an exercise band (or a stick clip) is a great way to start to open up the shoulder. Get creative with it — John Kettle has a [great video](https://www.instagram.com/p/B4955MOjdRS/) if you need inspiration. Finally, get your back working with some band-assisted I's, Y's, and T's. Be sure to keep a [hollow body](https://bodybuilding-wizard.com/hollow-body-hold-position/) with the core engaged and the chest not popping out.

[Grassroots Self Treatment](https://www.grassrootsselftreatment.com/products/climbing-cross-training-exercises) has an excellent Climber's Kit that is well worth the money. The warm-up section covers a great routine to use before climbing, including the I's, Y's, and T's I just mentioned. Tom Merrick also has a really great [Climber's Mobility Routine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-1OJW3OMb4&t=749s). I prefer to pick and choose a selection of exercises to use for warm-up, such as the open- and closed-hand wrist circles.

### During

If your elbows are acting up, there's no amount of adapting your movement on the wall that will stop them from taking trauma. Be humble, and don't push your limits. That said, assuming your symptoms are under control, there is a lot that can be done to mitigate strain on the elbows:

- **Keep your elbows tucked in.** Think about keeping the rotator cuff engaged such that the elbow crease opens outward (thumbs pointing up and out).
- **Don't hyperextend the elbows.** Straight arms relieve unnecessary bicep tension, but a slight bend will ease the stress on your elbows.
- **Pull your shoulders down** away from your ears, but without excessively pulling the shoulder blades towards each other.
- **Maintain good body tension** with the core engaged in a [hollow body](https://bodybuilding-wizard.com/hollow-body-hold-position/) position, especially on overhang.
- **Vary your grips** — especially if you've developed an unhealthy preference for crimping everything.
- **If you start to chicken wing, get off the wall immediately.**

Resources on how to hang right, such as [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTJudXtucpE), are a good starting point.

There's a common misconception that endurance climbing is about economy of movement, and therefore all muscles should be maximally relaxed at all times. While saving energy is crucial to performance on endurance routes, it's important to consider *which* muscles are relaxed. Think about how you can use good body tension with the larger muscle groups to keep from making risky movements and giving up on proper form. Generally speaking, as you learn more about proper form during supplemental exercises, try to carry that over to the wall.

### After

<div style="color: #b8d4b2;" markdown="1">

Cooling down is just as important as warming up, and it's the one that's easiest to skip. The goal is to bring blood flow back to the tissues that just took a beating and help flush out the metabolic byproducts.

- **Get some light cardio going** — jumping jacks, a short hike, or even a brisk walk. Something to keep blood circulating through the upper body without loading the elbows.
- **Light stretching** — nothing aggressive, just enough to maintain range of motion while the muscles are still warm.
- **Massage your forearms** — even a quick 2--3 minute session with your thumbs (or an Armaid if you have one) can make a noticeable difference in how you feel the next day.
