I used AI to help me get the structure and initial content down, and while the core advice reflects my real experience, there are passages where the AI got way too confident about things I haven't personally verified. If something reads like generic filler or makes a suspiciously specific claim, trust your gut — it probably needs work. I'm actively revising this, so bear with me.

In a way, I'm sorry you've arrived here. In another, I'm genuinely happy. I'm sorry you're dealing with elbow problems, but I'm thrilled you've made it to this page because I wrote it just for you. I want to provide you with useful resources and tips to get your elbows feeling strong and healthy, and to get you back to climbing. Most importantly, I want you to know that you are not alone, and you can beat this.

What is this article? I'd summarize it as a personal account of one climber's road to recovery from the elbow pain that plagues our community, accompanied by a wealth of resources and anecdotal advice on how to overcome it.

I am not a medical professional and I am by no means an elite climber, but along my journey to recovery I've consumed just about every resource out there, met with five physical therapists, and spoken with countless climbers who have suffered the same fate. As such, I'd like to believe this article does a better job than most at helping navigate the multitude of one-liner magic cures you'll hear — some of which will even contradict each other — and may serve as a comprehensive guide for how to holistically change your habits in order to overcome your injury.

**Disclaimer:** I am not a medical professional, and much of this is the anecdotal account of one individual. If you have any doubts — especially if you are in the initial acute phase of elbow pain, or considering medication and/or supplements — consult with a professional.

## Diagnosis

Before we dive in, let's make sure this article is for you. Do you have elbow tendonitis? The technical term is epicondylitis, specifically:

- **[Lateral epicondylitis](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/tennis-elbow/symptoms-causes/syc-20351987)** (tennis elbow) — pain on the outside of the elbow
- **Medial epicondylitis** (golfer's/climber's elbow) — pain on the inside of the elbow

<!-- TODO: Image — anatomical diagram of medial and lateral epicondyles -->

The main symptom is going to be an achy pain or heat right on the epicondyle or in the vicinity of it. Prodding around in the forearm with your thumb, you'll usually be able to find some trigger points or muscle lines that are particularly sore and sensitive.

Epicondylitis is a chronic overuse injury, so unlike an acute injury such as a pulley rupture, this isn't going to switch from healthy to injured in a single climbing session. That said, the noticeable symptoms may onset more abruptly than you'd expect.

If this is hitting close to home, welcome to the ever-growing mass of climbers that have suffered from this very, very stubborn injury. This article is for you.

## Don't Lose Hope

I had my first flare up about two years ago. I was doing laps on auto belay in the gym and my elbows just started feeling hot. I didn't think too much of it, but one or two sessions later I was lead climbing when this heat turned into pain that onset so aggressively I had to immediately come down. I was no stranger to injury, having had surgeries on a torn rotator cuff and twice on a torn ACL, but this was different.

I went to a doctor and had some other nagging issues diagnosed while I was there. As it turned out I had lateral epicondylitis in both elbows, [Dupuytren's contracture](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/dupuytrens-contracture/symptoms-causes/syc-20371943) in both hands, and a [ganglion cyst](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/ganglion-cyst/symptoms-causes/syc-20351156) on the PIP joint of my left index finger. I was instructed to immediately stop climbing, and after speaking with some other climbers I was told to get ready for months — or even years — without climbing. That elbow tendonitis could be the defining ceiling to my climbing performance.

<!-- TODO: Image — photos of injuries (Dupuytren's contracture, ganglion cyst) -->

I didn't know what to do with myself. I had effectively built an identity around climbing. All my friends were climbers, and it was the single thread that had strung together all of my relationships, activities, and life decisions outside of work. I immediately spiraled into thoughts of despair. I was 27 at the time, and I felt like my body was giving up on me. Is this what it means to age? To be plagued with overuse injuries that show their ugly heads every time you get too excited about your life's passion? And let's say I was able to find a way to continue climbing by switching to alpine adventures — would that mean I had reached my physical peak and shifted into a phase of constant fear of imminent elbow pain?

This didn't happen all at once. It went on for months... over a year. I kept learning more and more about my injury. I kept diligently following the recommendations for recovery. I tried every suggestion that came my way. But it always came back. Especially anytime I tried hard.

Most every resource would recommend a handful of prescribed actions as remedy:

- Stretch, massage, and ice. Nope.
- Tape, massage, and use a FlexBar. Still nothing.
- Do this stretch for your neck. Oh, that's working! ...wait, no. Never mind.

It was easy to lose hope. I eventually reached a point where any time someone tried to give me advice I just got angry and shut down. But this is why I'm writing now. Because I want you to know that you shouldn't lose hope. You don't have to give up your passion for climbing. You may have to spend some time focusing on recovery, but in doing so you are going to educate yourself and get to know your body in ways that will take you to new heights.

I'm excited to say that I am now free of elbow pain, at the peak of my fitness at age 29, and I just sent my personal best redpoint. What's more, I now see clear-as-day the path to continued progression, and throughout this journey I've developed an even more profound appreciation for this awesome sport we all love.

## Paradigm Shift

So what does it take? If none of these remedies work, then what does?

It starts with a paradigm shift in your relationship to climbing. Odds are that if you're facing tendonitis you've gotten pretty into climbing — enough to develop a chronic overuse injury, to say the least. Regardless of whatever level you're climbing at, you're probably putting in considerable effort, or volume. And perhaps you're also training in some fashion beyond simply climbing regularly. Maybe you're training a lot. But would you consider yourself a knowledgeable climbing athlete? How much do you know about human anatomy? What about in the context of climbing? Are you acutely aware of the day-to-day changes in your body? How much do you really know about the purpose of a hangboard, how to properly use it, and with what frequency?

You're going to need to educate yourself. A lot. You're going to have to get familiar with your body. And start to think more critically about how your climbing is structured — on both the day-to-day micro scale and the year-over-year macro scale.

Sorry to break it to you, but you cannot cure tendonitis after reading one article. Sure, I'll try to lay down as much as I can to get you started, but really, this is a continuous journey. The great news is that if you are persistent, you can continue to enjoy rock climbing throughout your entire life.

And this isn't just advice for amateurs. [Sam Elias had just put down a 5.14c before he got injured and realized he needed to go on a "knowledge quest."](https://www.grassrootsphysicaltherapy.com/physical-therapy-treatment/2019/10/30/hang-right-part-4-the-knowledge-quest-lesson-1)

If there is one thing I could leave you with, it is the hope and excitement to start this knowledge quest — to learn how to simultaneously take care of your body and reach your potential. The rest of this article could effectively be considered a jump start on your journey.

## The Big Four

*This guy just criticized all these other articles for listing "the three things you must do" and now he's going to give me the same crap??? Oh... I see how it's different... there's four.*

I know. I get it... but still, I think lists are helpful, so I made one.

1. **Educate Yourself**
2. **Structure Your Training**
3. **Perform Supplemental Exercises**
4. **Know Your Body**

**Educate yourself.** The more the better. Read books. Listen to podcasts. Get on YouTube. Talk to climbers. Anything you can learn about anatomy, physical training, injury prevention, and all of these things in the context of climbing. But don't limit yourself to climbing resources — there's a wealth of knowledge about general fitness and mobility training, patterns and good practices to be observed. Just be careful taking tried-and-true strategies for large muscle groups and applying them to your fingers.

**Structure your training.** The aim of the game is to stay in the sweet spot between detraining and injury. This is going to take a lot of trial and error, but you simply cannot afford not to start using periodized training programs. More on this below.

**Perform supplemental exercises.** If longevity is the goal, supplemental exercises can be assumed mandatory. I break these down into two subcategories: injury prevention and base fitness. There is a lot of talk out there about antagonist exercises, but as far as I'm concerned, these can just be bunched into the base fitness category. More on this below.

**Know your body.** Do you know the [science of swimology](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stjeS6TRSPo&t=36s)? It is one thing to study, and another to experience. Monitor your body day-to-day. Massage and observe where you are sore. Learn the difference between an acceptable level of discomfort and a level that indicates something is not well.

By now you may have noticed that all of these "big four" are continued practices. None of them stop when tendonitis eases up. Of course there is ebb and flow, times when we are more or less disciplined, but each of these is something to pursue for a lifetime.

## A Note on Where I'm Coming From

A lot of what we're going to get into comes indirectly from the mouths of professionals, to me, to you, but some is also very specific to myself and should be taken with a grain of salt — particularly if you are very different from me. As such, I thought it would be helpful to give you some context.

I am an avid rock climber who has been involved in the sport for essentially my entire life. I wasn't one of those "team kids" crushing every project at the local crag, but my dad took me on wild multi-pitch adventures in the Gunks and Adirondacks of upstate NY from a very young age. This resulted in my head-game and technique being advanced for my level, with my strength typically lagging behind my peers. Since then I have become progressively more addicted to the sport. My tendonitis started while living in Michigan, where I was logging lots of hours at the gym due to the lack of outdoor opportunity. I was making good progress with training, but I didn't have much structure beyond "do all the hard things all the time."

Some stats: 29, male, 6'0", 160--170 lb, +4" wingspan.

One detail worth noting: I'm hypermobile. Not circus-performer level, but I have good range of motion off the couch. I think this has made me predisposed to injuries like dislocating my shoulder, hyperextending my knee (and tearing my ACL), and now tendonitis. As such, I've found that stretching certain joints is not critical for me, and that I have to be very careful not to hyperextend my elbows — even for something like planche training, where proper form is supposedly locked elbows.

<!-- TODO: Image — hypermobility in elbows and wrists -->

It took me years to figure this out and recognize how to adapt advice to fit my unique traits. What traits do you have that may have made you prone to tendonitis?
